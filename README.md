# Committing Format

## Format
```
[action] description
```

## Example
```
[add] About field
[fix] Unknown variable error
[typo] totla_price -> total_price
[rmv] storage/tmp folder
```

##### You can use your own action badges and/or more sophisticated ones.
Example:
* [change]
* [delete]
* [refactor]
* [test]


If you consistently commit for each change (or pile of changes that address one particular issue) then you will not have to write long descriptions for commits. Like Single Responsibility principle. Keep your commits description small and readable for future self
